Ahng´oodloo is very fond of father, and 119when he found he could not go back with us he took “Billy Bah” up on the mountain so they would not have to say good-bye. All the natives felt sad to have father leave them, but after we had all the venison we needed we steamed away. Poor old Koodluk´too felt very badly, and so did I.</p><p>I was kept busy caring for my pets on the way home, and one morning I found one of my bunnies dead. He had been killed by one of the others in a fight. They are all white as snow and perfect beauties.</p><p>“_Hard Over_”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">We stopped among the west side Eskimos 120at a whaling station. I didn’t like the looks of these natives at all. I am sure they are not as kind as father’s people. The babies are not nearly as pretty. Their dress looks</p></div> </div>
