She came to AH-NI-GHI´-TO’S home in Washington and spent a year with her and then returned to the Snowland.</p><p>Ahnǵoodloo was one of the only two left-handed men in the tribe, and he was the best hunter of all. He was very fond of AH-NI-GHI´-TO’S father and always stayed with him.</p><p>Achatinǵwah also had another brother, Wee-shá-kup-sie, who spent a year in New York City and returned to his country when AH-NI-GHI´-TO´S 59father went there the last time. So Achatinǵwah knew more about the ways of the “Kab´loonahs” (white people) than most of her tribe.</p><p>“_BILLY BAH_”</p></div> </div>
