Windward,” <em>July 29, 1900</em>.</p><p>My dear Uncle,—Nearly every day has been fine.</p><p>In the Straits of Belle Isle we passed many large cakes of ice. I am glad we had sunshine, because Captain 18Bartlett, whom I like very much, says there are rocks there too. If our ship should strike either of these it would wreck her; and we might easily run against them if the fog was thick and he could not see ahead.</p><p>My kitty is very wild and will not come to me, though I feed her milk and bread and try my best to make friends with her. The Captain is very jolly, and helps me have fun. He has had a nice swing put up for me on deck, and when our ship does not roll too much I have fine times there.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Percy, the maid, says she never saw children play, that where she comes from they only sit with their hands in their laps and keep quiet. I am glad I don’t live in that</p></div> </div>
