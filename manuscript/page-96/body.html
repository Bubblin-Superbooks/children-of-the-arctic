After the walls were three or four feet high the whole was roofed over. Usually this is done with large flat stones, but as Achatinǵwah’s father was in a hurry to get his family moved into the house he threw a walrus-hide over the top and held it down with heavy rocks to keep the wind from blowing it off.</p><p>The igloo was then thickly covered with snow, and the inside of it lined with seal skins.</p><p>The doorway, or entrance, was scarcely two feet high, and opened into a long, low passage-way which ended in a vestibule as high as the igloo itself. This passage-way and vestibule Achatinǵwah’s father built of snow-blocks.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The natives leave their fox-skin kapetahs (coats) in</p></div> </div>
