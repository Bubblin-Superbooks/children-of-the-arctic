There he stood, twice as tall as any one else, and we had not seen him because he had on light kamiks, white bear-skin trousers, and gray shirt, and he looked the same colour as the rocks behind him.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I thought we would never land, but at last, father swung himself on board, and I was in dear old dad’s arms, hugged up tight. Of course now I was anxious to go ashore and see Charley and Matt and Koodluk´too and “Cin,” my dog that I left in Koodluk´too’s care. “Billy Bah” was there, too, father said, and they were all waiting to see me. We all went ashore after father had said “How do” to every one on board.
